# START MENU

Credit `Voluptua` (me) if you are using any resource from this branch!

This branch contains a custom start menu for vanilla pokeemerald. 
It's compatible with Dynamic Overworld Palettes and with the safari zone. \\
**IMPORTANT:** I am no professional and there are infinite other ways to write the code better than I do. I realized that it could have been heavily improved. So adding a new menu option is REALLY difficult! (But you can change the current menu options, like I do for my Hack). \\ 
But there's another thing. If you use this for your hack and in your storyline, you change the order of what new menu option is added, you have to change some horrible functions I have created. New options are added like this: `First the Party option, then the PokeDex and then the PokeNav`. So if the player in your hack, gets these menus in a different order, you will have a hard time :smile: ! TODO: Add Tutorials
